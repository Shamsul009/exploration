What is Generative AI?
    Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content, 
    rather than only analyze or predict existing data.

    Generative AI learns patterns from data and then generates new,
    realistic data that did not exist before.

    It works by:
        1.Learning the probability distribution of the data
        2.Generating new samples from that learned distribution

    Examples of generated content include text, images, audio, video, and code.

Why is Generative AI different from Deep Learning?
    Generative AI is a subset of Deep Learning, but with a specific goal.

    Deep Learning (general) focuses on:
        1.Prediction
        2.Classification
        3.Detection(e.g., spam detection, image classification, price prediction)

    Generative AI focuses on:
        Creating new, realistic data (e.g., writing text, generating images, composing music)

So, all Generative AI models use deep learning, but not all deep learning models are generative.

What is a Probability Distribution?
    A probability distribution tells us how likely each possible outcome is.
    In simple terms, it answers the question: “Out of all possible options, how likely is each one?”

How Probability Distribution affects Generative AI and Deep Learning ?

Example
    Sentence: I love eating ___
    From training data, the model learns the probability of different next words:
        Next Word	    Probability
        pizza	           0.40
        rice	           0.25
        burger	           0.20
        ice-cream	       0.10
        car	              0.0001

    This table represents a probability distribution over possible next words.


The model does not always choose “pizza”
Instead, it samples from the probability distribution
Words with higher probability are more likely, but lower-probability words are still possible
This is why: Responses feel natural , Outputs are not always identical

Key Difference in How Probability is Used : 
    
    In Traditional Deep Learning
    The model often selects the single most likely output
    Example: choosing only "pizza" (classification)

    In Generative AI
    The model samples from the full probability distribution
    This allows variation, creativity, and realism
