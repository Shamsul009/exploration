How Laravel Scheduler Works with OS Cron
1️⃣ OS Cron is the trigger
Server’s cron (Linux, Unix, etc.) executes php artisan schedule:run every minute. It doesn’t care what Laravel project does—it just calls PHP.

2️⃣ Laravel Kernel is the manager
 When schedule:run is triggered, Laravel boots the Console Kernel (app/Console/Kernel.php). The Kernel knows all registered commands and their schedules.

3️⃣ Commands are the workers
 Commands contain the actual logic. The Kernel checks which commands should run at the current time and executes them.

💡 Example:
If a command is scheduled with everyTwoHours() and the project is deployed at 6:45, it won’t run immediately. The next execution will be at 8:00, because Laravel runs commands at fixed time intervals, not relative to deployment.

4️⃣ When working with Laravel scheduled commands, these two methods withoutOverlapping() , runInBackground() are critical to understand:

⚡ withoutOverlapping()
  Prevents a scheduled command from running again if the previous execution is still in progress.
  Laravel uses a cache lock (Redis, database, etc.) to ensure only one instance runs at a time.
👉 Useful when:
  1.Commands are long-running
  2.Duplicate execution can cause data inconsistency
  3.Same records are being updated


⚡ runInBackground()
  Runs the command asynchronously in a separate process, so the scheduler is not blocked.
  Other scheduled commands can continue running without waiting.
👉 Useful when:
  1.Multiple commands run at the same minute
  2.Commands are heavy or time-consuming
